# The final modifier in Java

When we use the final modifier, we prevent any further modifications to that component.
- a final method means it can't be overridden by a subclass.
- a final field means an object's field can't be reassigned or given a different value, after its initialization.
- a final static field is a class field that can't be reassigned, or given a different value, after the class's initialization process.
- a final class can't be overridden, meaning no class can use it, in the extends clause.
- a final variable, in a block of code, means that once it's assigned a value, any remaining code in the block can't change it.
- a final method parameter means, we can't assign a different value to that parameter in the method code block.
