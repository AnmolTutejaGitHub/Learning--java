// deep copy in java 

// In Java, there is no built-in deepcopy method like in some other programming languages. 
//However, you can achieve deep copying by implementing it yourself or using third-party libraries.

// Here is a basic example of how you can implement a deep copy for a class in Java:

//using  third-party libraries like Apache Commons Lang or Gson, which provide utility methods for deep copying.
// For instance, using Apache Commons Lang:

import org.apache.commons.lang3.SerializationUtils;

class MyClass {
    // Your class fields and methods

    public MyClass deepCopy() {
        return SerializationUtils.clone(this);
    }
}
