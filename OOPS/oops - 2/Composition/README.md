In Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that allows you to structure your code using objects, which are instances of classes. Composition is one of the fundamental principles of OOP, and it involves creating relationships between classes by including instances of other classes within one class. This is achieved by composing objects to create more complex ones.
